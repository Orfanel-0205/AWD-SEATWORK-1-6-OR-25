## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
This project is a Grade Weighted Average (GWA) Calculator that allows users to input their grades, calculates their GWA, and determines scholarship eligibility based on predefined grade criteria. It ensures data persistence using localStorage, so user inputs and results remain even after a page reload. The project features a smooth user experience with real-time feedback and automatic form submission upon reload.

Guiding Question:
- This is a Grade Weighted Average (GWA) Calculator that helps users compute their GWA based on inputted grades and credit units.
- The purpose is to provide an easy-to-use utility where users can input their grades and credit units, calculate their GWA, and store/retrieve previous inputs using localStorage.
- HTML Structure: Includes an input form for grades, a navigation menu, and a results display section.
JavaScript Functionality: Handles form submission, GWA computation, local storage for saving user data, and UI updates.
CSS Styling: Uses modern styles with a gradient background, animations, and responsive design for a sleek UI.
- HTML: Defines the structure of the page.
CSS: Provides styling with gradients, animations, and responsive design.
JavaScript: Handles GWA calculation, stores data in localStorage, and updates UI dynamically.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.
